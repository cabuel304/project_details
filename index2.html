        <p class="card-text">The inspiration from this model came from my love of science fiction creatures or other alien objects. Some of it came from Terraria and I tried to picture myself as a head model designer for a pixel game turned 3D. It is scary to see where my model creature would look like because I have a habit of not planning things and letting things happen once it feels right. This creature design has a more waterworld feel to it with tentacles and a claw which makes it more like a Subnautica creature.</p>

        <p class="Title">When the pandemic hit, I was stuck on watching movies I have missed or have not seen. It wasn't until I heard that the Age of Resistance prequel to The Dark Crystal was cancelled on Netflix when I decided to watch the 1982 film. After watching, it was stuck in my for weeks. I loved the film for its story and character designs. The atmosphere blew me away.</p>
        <img src="images/Crystal.png" class="Crystal" alt="Crystal">
        <p>The crystal has most of the main characters in their usual form. I wanted the crystal to showcase the personality of the movie and that I mean the beauty of puppeteer culture.</p>

        <p>The short story I made is more of a thriller ghost story. A journalist working for a news station has been offered an assignment. She was offered an interview by an unknown person or so she thought. As time goes on as she drives to the location, strange things occur.</p>

        <p2 class="Logo-Paragraphs">From the start of this draft, a lot of forward thinking was needed. The designs are made on a sketchbook and are essential to the creation of a great logo. Even though all are not perfect, at least it was something to give life on. The second image shows the final product on what the logo would look like with simple detail and no coloring. The third image shows the title and font I gave to the logo. The fourth image shows the coloring and the finished product.</p2>
